# Syncs git repository with subversion, using an extra git client.
#
# The client is a clone of the git repo. It has two branches:
#  - master: It is sync'ed with the git repo. Should always
#            fast-forward.
#  - GIT_SVN_SYNC_BRANCH: Sync'ed with SVN (via git-svn). Noone else
#            can write to svn.
#
# The changes from the git repo are pulled into master, and then
# merged to the svn sync branch. This branch is then synchronized with
# subversion.
#
# Required environment variabless:
#  - GIT_SCRIPTS: directory where the git sync scripts are located
#  - GIT_SVN_SYNC_BASE: directory where the sync repositories are
# stored.
#
# Optional environment variables:
#  - GIT_SVN_SYNC_EMAIL: email to send error reports to
#  - GIT_SVN_SYNC_BRANCH: name of the branch that is synchronized with
# subversion (default = svn-sync).
#
# Usage: git-sync-with-svn.sh project_name
